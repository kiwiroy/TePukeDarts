## Game

The game is called **killer**

## Aim

To knock off opponents by landing darts on their chosen number.

## Rules

1. Handicaps agreed by majority of players at the beginning.
2. Number selection, everyone throws a single dart to select their unique number using their opposite hand to normal (this round only). If you hit a bull you can decide to throw again or take the bull
3. Person who starts is the closest to bull for first dart, the rest play based on name order on the board.
4. To start and become a killer:-
  1. Novices hit their number the agreed number of times (doubles & treble count)
  2. Regular players hit their number the agreed number of times but using the small triangle (trebles count)
5. Killing. Novice players can kill with full triangle, rest small.  Doubles and trebles don’t count.
6. Player's who haven’t started can be killed.
7. Life saver - hit your own number (triangle rule above) and you gain a life, only one life per hand (3 darts). Doubles & trebles don’t count.
8. Bringing back the dead.  Players who are a killer can bring back the dead by hitting the dead players number.  A dead player can only get one life returned.
